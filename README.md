# AI-POWERED-DASHBOARD-FOR-CUSTOMER-SUPPORT
AI powered dashboard for customer support ticket clustering and feature improvement.
OVERVIEW:

This project aims to revolutionize how Product Managers (PMs) interact with customer feedback by transforming overwhelming volumes of unstructured support tickets into actionable, product-improving insights, delivered via an intelligent dashboard.

THE CHALLENGE (The Problem)

Businesses are currently overwhelmed by the sheer volume and unstructured nature of support tickets. This prevents Product Managers (PMs) from identifying recurring issues in a timely, data-backed manner. As a result, product improvement cycles are slow, and critical customer pain points persist unnecessarily.

THE SOLUTION (Prescriptive Hybrid AI Dashboard)

We are developing an AI Dashboard that automatically clusters customer complaints (e.g., "Login Issues," "Checkout Bug") and goes a step further: it generates specific feature improvement suggestions complete with business justification and estimated effort. This allows PMs to skip manual ticket reading and immediately focus on prioritization.

KEY CAPABILITIES:

Automated Topic Clustering: Uses NLP to group thousands of tickets into clear, manageable categories.

Prescriptive Feature Suggestions: Generates concrete product changes (e.g., "Implement 2FA on login").

Business Justification: Provides data on the number of affected users and potential churn risk.

Estimated Effort: Includes rough estimations for engineering planning.

Prioritization View: Enables PMs to decisively prioritize and hand off features to engineering.

ULTIMATE GOAL:

To enable PMs to decisively prioritize and hand off validated features to engineering, thereby accelerating the product improvement roadmap, driving overall product quality, and significantly reducing preventable customer churn.
